"""Deterministic guard for any model-written text before it reaches the user.

Wired into POST /chat (app/routers/chat.py). The product rule: Atossa never names a condition as a finding,
gives a probability, suggests a cause, or recommends treatment. A system prompt alone is
not enough, so every model-written string goes through check() and, on a hit, is replaced
by a fixed fallback. The user's own words are not checked here: echoing them back is fine.
